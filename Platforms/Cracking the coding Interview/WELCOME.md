# 📗 Cracking the Coding Interview (CCI)

Here, we're going to add optimized solutions of the problems given in **CCI** in C++ or Python. If you're interested in adding a solution or have suggestions in any other languages:

- First, 🔍 if there's a **Pull Request (PR)** for that problem by any other user or not.
- Already **PR** present ? Write in the discussions why your solution is better than their solution. (🕙 Time Complexiy, 🌌 Space Complexity, Redundany, etc..)
- No **PR** ? In that case, go ahead and 🙋 PR mentioning how the solution works. You can use comments, Psuedocode, etc.Also mention the 🕙 complexity and 🌌 complexity for the solution.

Also, I'm here to learn Competitive Programming which isn't that easy 🖖. So, *suggestions* are always welcome.

# ðŸ¤” How to solve a Problem ?

Below are some points which will help you to solve a problem. Use this in your practice.

### 1. Listen

    Pay very close attention to any information in the problem description. 
    You probably need it all for an optimal algorithm

### 2. Example

    Most examples are too small or are special. Debug your example. 
    Is there any way it's special case ? Is it big enough?

### 3. Brute Force

    Try to solve the problem using Brute-force as soon as possible. Don't worry if it's not efficient. State a naive algorithm and its runtime, then optimize from there. Don't code yet though!

### 4. Optimize

    Use BUD optimization:
    - Bottlenecks
    - Unnecessary Work
    - Duplicated Work

### 5. Walk Through

    Now that you've an optimial solution, walk through your approach in detail. Make sure you understand each detail before you start coding.

### 6. Implement

    Write Beautiful Code.
    - Modularize your code.
    - Refactor to clean up.

### 6. Test

    Test this in order:
    - Conceptual Test.
    - Unusual or non-standard code.
    - Hot spots, like arithmetic and null nodes.
    - Snall test cases. It's much faster than a big  test case and just as effective.
    - Special cases and edge cases.
